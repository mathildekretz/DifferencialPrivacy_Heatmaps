## General Information
The final presentation can be viewed in the [Differential_Privacy_Presentation.pdf](Differential_Privacy_Presentation.pdf) file.

### setup
run on classical python 3.9 without particular version

**User.py**
Implement the extraction of probability distribution from the GOWALLA dataset proposed by the paper, can search for the most lived area, can be controled with the number of users and latitute/longitude ranges

**main.py**
Implement the main classes used for the algorithms of the paper. Notations and operation are completely based on what was described by the authors. All parameters are to change within the main(), so argument management has been made. To run with 
> python main.py

**User2.py and main2.py**
Implement small changes for the extention of our work for the COVID 19 dataset
